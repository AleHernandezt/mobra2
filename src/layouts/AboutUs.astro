        MOBRA as it is today, is an ambitious dream inspired by cars, passion,
        and determination. Throughout its creation, two major states were in
        mind for the rise of the company: New York and Florida. January ’24
        was the pillar of creation for MOBRA, specifically in Miami. From that
        point in time, the company has risen from its beginnings and will
        continue to thrive through its ambition. MOBRA’s goal is to become the
        best car detailing company in the US, eventually in the world.
